<h1>About SFT's</h1>

<dl >
    <li>What is an SFT</li>
    <ul>
    <li>An S.F.T or somewhat fungible token is following the footsteps of NFT’s in making it so that exclusive works of are able to be owned by lucky investors</li>
    
    <li>The way the SFT’s will work is you will pay for access to the wallet that has access to the specific SFT. This allows each SFT to be divisible to separate people</li>
    
    <li>To gain access you will need to pay in Ethereum (This will allow you to trade these interchangeably)</li>
    
    <li>The S.F.T is going to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <li>Our SFT’s will be able to have exclusive ownership of the image while multiple people will be able to own it. This is done by the rank system that we have.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Each image will be in a ranking system as the number gets higher the more lines the photo has</li>
    <ul>
    <li>If you have number one you have no restrictions on the image</li>
   
    <ul>
    <li>Ex: number 1 will have no lines thru the image and number
  2 will have 1 line..etc...</li>
  </ul>  </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>If you have the highest number the more difficult it is to view the
  image</li>
      <ul>
  <li>Ex: number 10 will have 10 lines through the image</li>
    </ul>  </ul>
  <li>Only Company Co can add SFT’s to the server; no independent artist may upload their own drawings.</li>
  
  <li>All drawings must be submitted to Company Co for appraisal</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Know SFT’s what they are used for</li>
    <ul>
  <li>SFT’s are following the premise of NFT’s or Non Fungible Tokens.</li>
    <ul>
  <li>While NFT’s are commonly thought of as art pictures numerous things from videos to music can be an NFT</li>
  
  <li>The nonfungible portion of NFT is stated because unlike other cryptocurrencies you cannot trade these interchangeably.</li>
    <ul>
  <li>example - Fungible tokens or assets are divisible and non-unique. For instance, fiat currencies like the dollar are fungible: A $1 bill in New York City has the same value as a $1 bill in Miami. A fungible token can also be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin: 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC, no matter where it is issued. .</li>
    </ul>
  <li>NFTs are typically stored on the Ethereum block chain</li>
    <ul>
  <li>While making any transactions on this blockchain anything must
  be done in Ethereum</li>
    </ul>
     </ul>  </ul>
